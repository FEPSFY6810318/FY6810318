  <p class="ex1">
 <p>This article presents an insight on the influence the James Webb space telescope has had on 
 the space industry and other industries in general.  This article includes key facts 
 on the telescope as well as comparisons to an older space telescope (Hubble) showing the technological 
 advances that the space industry has had in building the $10 billion telescope. Also, by showing 
 its key discoveries from images and  by ‘observing galaxies, star formation, and exoplanets’ millions 
 of years ago you will be able to read how the telescope has been able to provide useful data for 
 scientists that will impact future generations and what the future holds from it.</p> 
  </p>
  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
 <p>‘The James Webb Space Telescope took more than two decades and $10 billion to build. It's one of NASA's most expensive science projects. 
 A combination of difficult engineering and mismanagement led to cost overruns and delays.
 Now it's nearly a million miles from Earth, preparing to capture images of the first stars that formed over 13 billion years ago’ (ref1). 
 The James Webb Space Telescope stands as a demonstration to human innovation, resilience and curiosity for knowledge about our universe. 
 With the introduction of this telescope, it has revolutionised the space industry for future generations by untangling the mysteries of the universe. 
 It has aided other scientists such as better understanding how heavier elements are created. 
 First, let's give some brief facts about the ‘$10 billion’ telescope.</p>
    
 </p>
 <h3 id="Analysis and discussion">Analysis and discussion</h3>
 <p class="ex1">
 <p>So, the James Webb telescope was built between 3 space agencies which were: NASA, European space agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space agency (CSA). 
  This international collaboration between the 3 agencies is one of the biggest in space exploration history.
  It took ‘over 2 decades’ to build the telescope with construction ‘began in 2004’(Ref2). 
  As well as this, the telescope was so expensive as it’s one of the most expensive space telescopes ever built. 
  The cost was so high due to a ‘combination of difficult engineering and mismanagement led to cost overruns and delays.’ 
  This further highlights the feat that it took to build the telescope and further emphasise the resilience it took to build this technologically advanced telescope. 
  ‘NASA's infrared space observatory, launched on Dec 25, 2021, from ESA's launch site at Kourou in French Guiana, aboard an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket’ (Ref3).</p>
 <p>The rocket launch for the telescope involved huge technological design. As the mass of the telescope is’6,200kg’ and the size of its largest component is the sunshield which stretches to about ’22 metres’, 
 the telescope can be quite difficult to transport. However, engineers working on the telescope have been able to adapt it to be able to be transported efficiently and easier by folding it in. 
 This is shown on the image below showing a model of it in the Ariane 5 rocket.
 As well as this, there was key technological advances in the design of it when the telescope got unfolded. 
 The process steps include: ‘Deploying, tensioning, and separating Webb’s sunshield, a five-layer, diamond-shaped structure the size of a tennis court;
 extending its secondary mirror support structure; and unfolding its primary mirror, which has a honeycomb-like pattern of 18 hexagonal, gold-coated mirror segments’ (Ref 4).
 This extensive process was done remotely by NASA team which is an important step for the space industry as it shows how something expensive and new can be operated in a way to be put into space successfully.</p>
   <img src="james webb rocket picture.png" alt="Image 1" width="466" height="653"> 
 <p>Now, let’s compare this space telescope to its predecessor which was the Hubble space telescope (shown in the image below).
  By comparing these two telescopes, you’ll be able to see the technological advancements made over 3 decades. These improvements can transform the space industry.
  Firstly, using table 1’s data (Ref5) for some comparisons of the two telescopes, you can see that the James Webb telescope is significantly lighter 
  than the Hubble telescope (6,000 kg lighter) showing the technological innovation over 3 decades. 
  Also, the James Webb telescope has a larger mirror size than the Hubble telescope which means that the Webb telescope provide scientists with ‘views of object up to 100 times fainter than Hubble can see’(Ref6). 
  This demonstrates how the Webb telescope can aid the space industry with improvements in images being taken by the Webb by seeing the fainter objects. 
  The reason for this improvement is due to the Webb’s range of wavelength’s that it detects which is ‘600-28,500 Nm’ whereas the Hubble telescope detects the range of wavelength that is ’90-2,500 Nm’. 
  With a larger range of wavelengths, this enables the Webb telescope to have more detailed images than its predecessor which will gather more information about our universe for scientists.</p>

  <p>The James Webb Space telescope has influenced the space industry through its discoveries. 
   One key discovery was that from recent findings the telescope has ‘spotted galaxies form the first 350 million years after the Big bang’ (Ref 7). 
   This discovery makes these galaxies ‘the earliest’ ones after the big bang. 
   Observations from these images taken by it have surprised scientists as the galaxies ‘are far brighter than expected’ which has contributed the way scientists think about ‘how galaxies form in the early universe’ 
   as this wasn’t expected. As well as this, the telescope has made key discoveries on exoplanets (planets that orbit stars which is not the sun) as it was  
   ‘able to detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of an exoplanet for the first time’. The telescope also discovered ‘a host of other compounds’ which is a huge breakthrough for scientists. 
   Now, they can understand the planetary structure of its atmosphere and see how it behaves when there’s interactions with ‘light from the planet’s host star’. 
   This information can be critical if mankind ever pursues the search for habitable planets that can sustain life in the future which will be hugely beneficial for astronomers as well.</p>
   <p>The James Webb Space telescope’s success has led to NASA constructing the ‘Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope’ (Ref 8). 
    It’s an Infra-red telescope which is designed to gather data in the ‘areas of dark energy, exoplanets and infrared astrophysics’. 
    This will further expand our understanding of the universe by attempting to ‘settle essential questions’ scientists want answered which will benefit the industry. 
    With manned explorations hopefully being launched in the next few years with the Artemis missions, the data collected from the telescope can provide data for further manned exploration 
    in the future after these missions such as mars exploration.This therefore shows a promising future for the industry with the amount of activity happening.</p>
   
   <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <p>This article examined the extent of how the James Webb space telescope revolutionises the future of the space industry. 
   Across the article, it has been demonstrated that the James Webb telescope has significantly impacted the space industry from its innovative design to its key discoveries that have influenced future projects. 
   Furthermore, the telescope has revolutionised the industry with its technological advancements and challenges. Not only the technology advancements from the Hubble telescope will revolutionise the industry, 
   but it was also one of the last collaborations with 3 major space agencies showing that anything may be possible for the future with the collaboration of top engineers and scientists further proving the statement.</p>
